Apply only the concrete authorized finding-scoped correction supplied by the parent. Keep the patch surgical, update focused regression evidence when needed, and run the smallest relevant checks. Do not broaden scope, start another review, push or merge.

If the semantic invariant behind the authorized finding materially recurs in a supported sibling branch/consumer, check for the same failure class while staying read-only outside the correction envelope. If a sibling issue is found outside the authorized envelope, report it as a new finding/HUMAN STOP condition; do not absorb or fix it opportunistically.
