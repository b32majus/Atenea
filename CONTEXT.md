# Atenea Context

Status: **CURRENT SYSTEM CONTEXT — C-086**

## Purpose

Atenea makes autonomous engineering work safer, reproducible and economical without rebuilding capabilities already owned by OpenCode or adopted upstream skills.

## Current architecture

```text
accepted product authority
→ existing Herdr operator workspace/pane
→ visible native OpenCode V2 TUI (`opencode .`)
→ selected Atenea profile
→ Matt skill appropriate to the work
→ fresh role-bound subagents / worktrees
→ deterministic evidence
→ one coordinator-owned independent Matt Standards + Spec review
→ up to two fresh finding-scoped corrections when needed
→ composed-state checks for material trains/features
→ Cora integrated audit at material PR/feature/train boundary
→ human publication / merge decision
→ post-merge worktree closeout
```

Atenea owns policy, bindings and conformance evidence. Material product shaping remains an attended Cora + human decision loop; OpenCode executes shaped authority and must STOP rather than self-answer unresolved product questions. Expansive shaping methods operate inside explicit non-negotiable product rails and conditional fidelity checkpoints. Product fidelity also survives decomposition/composition: internal domain richness and aggregate boundaries are not user-interface authority, and material cumulative UI is checked as a composed product when risk warrants it. Atenea does not own a second task graph, TDD method, review rubric, worktree algorithm or review lifecycle.

## Profiles

### `volume`

- coordinator: MiMo 2.6 Flash;
- explorer: Qwen 3.8 Flash;
- implementer: DeepSeek V4 Flash (provider currently serves V4.1 under this ID);
- merger: MiMo 2.6 Flash;
- Standards review: GPT-6 Luna high;
- Spec review: GPT-6 Luna high;
- correction: DeepSeek V4 Flash;
- deep OCR: normally off.

### `complex`

- coordinator: MiMo 2.6 Flash;
- explorer: Qwen 3.8 Flash;
- implementer: GLM 5.3 Flash high;
- merger: MiMo 2.6 Flash;
- Standards review: GPT-6 Luna high;
- Spec review: GPT-6.1 Sol high;
- correction: GLM 5.3 Flash high;
- deep OCR: GLM 5.3 Flash high when triggered.

`complex` remains a risk/assurance class, and under standard cost it now also selects the distinct GLM 5.3 Flash high first-writer route. This is fixed routing at a clean work-unit boundary, not quota-based switching.

## Complex triggers

Use `complex` for material semantic/acceptance risk such as cross-cutting architecture, difficult state/concurrency/temporal semantics, material auth/privacy/tenancy/clinical trust boundaries, delicate migration/back-compat invariants or repeated semantic failure.

Do not select it from file count, ticket length, ordinary UI work, number of tests or business importance alone.

## Thin execution restoration

C-086 retains the C-085 runtime/model split below but restores C-084-style thin execution: specialized product/fidelity safeguards are conditional and phase-owned, coordinator→writer delegation references durable handoffs instead of duplicating them, writer evidence is focused, and broad/full suites default to integration/publication boundaries. See `docs/CURRENT_EXECUTION_DECISION_C086.md`.

## Standard writer/context economy

Standard `volume` writes on V4 and standard `complex` writes on GLM 5.3 Flash high. The active OpenCode 2.0.22 runtime gives both long-running NaN writers a 220k effective context budget with automatic compaction and ~15k recent verbatim retention, so pathological agent loops compact around ~198k instead of drifting toward the physical ~1M window. Required evidence is never reduced for token economy.

## Assurance

Deterministic gates remain first-line evidence. Semgrep is conditional on relevant static/security risk. Alibaba Open Code Review is selective high-risk/deep semantic assurance, not routine per-ticket review.

Feature/train/PR integrated audit is performed by Cora outside the OpenCode role graph when the boundary is material.

## Historical runtime

Gentle, Pi relay, ASSESS, RDD/4R, lineages, burn, review hosts and OpenCode V1 transport remain historical evidence only. They are not required by C-084.

Herdr remains supported operator infrastructure for persistent process/session control and observation; it is not correctness authority.

## Free cost-policy extension

Atenea also supports `cost_policy: free_only`, independent of the `volume|complex` risk class. Human/project cost authority wins; Free never silently escalates to paid bindings. See `docs/ATENEA_FREE_PROFILE_V0.md`.
